                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>In 2022, a Government Order (GO) was passed to establish a new college in every district of Tamil Nadu (TN) under the leadership of Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin. The Government Arts and Science College in Serkadu was opened at the Vallimalai Government School. On September 5, 2022, a function was held, organized by Velmurugan, the Chairman of Katpadi, who also obtained permission to relocate the college to Thiruvalluvar University in Serkadu.
                   A few months later, a site was allocated for the construction of a new building for our college in the playground of Thiruvalluvar University. The foundation stone was laid on February 10, 2023. After the completion of construction, the building inauguration took place on June 24, 2024, and our college was inaugurated by the chief guest, Dhuraimurugan, the Water Resources Minister and MLA of Katpadi.
                   The following week, our college completely moved from Thiruvalluvar University to its new location.
